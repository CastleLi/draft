Description: Power calculations are a critical component of any research study to determine the 
	minimum sample size necessary to detect differences between multiple groups. 
	Researchers often work with data taking the form of proportions that can be modeled with 
	a beta distribution. Here we present an R package, BetaPASS, and analogous SAS macro, 
	that perform power and sample size calculations for data following a beta distribution 
	with comparative nonparametric output. This package allows flexibility with multiple 
	options for link functions to fit the data and graphing functionality for visual comparisons.
